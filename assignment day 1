1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry
software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 
efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
 scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
 security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
.mastering complexity
Mastering process
Mastering machine


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
 requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
design - building the framework. 
coding - converting software design into tangible code.
 testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility,
 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.


agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.
